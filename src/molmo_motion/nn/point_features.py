"""
Point feature extraction for 2D-grounded trajectory prediction.

Pipeline (no cross-attention variant):
1. MultiScalePointFeatureExtractor: grid_sample from the ANCHOR frame's ViT
   patches at 2D coords → (B, P, vit_dim).
2. Reuse the pretrained Molmo2 connector MLP (image_projector) to project to
   the LLM embedding dim → (B, P, d_model).
3. The result is injected into the `<|point_feat|>` token positions (P per
   example — one per point, no per-frame duplication).
