"""Optional integration dependencies (wandb, beaker).

Training-time logging integrations are optional installs:

    pip install molmo-motion[train]    # wandb
    pip install beaker-py             # only useful on Ai2's Beaker cluster

When a package is missing, this module exposes a stub (wandb) or None
(beaker symbols) so the trainer imports cleanly; anything that actually
needs the integration raises a helpful error at use time.
