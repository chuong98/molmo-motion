"""Public configuration class for MolmoMotion.

A user-facing subset of the model's full internal config. Mirrors the
training-time settings so that:
  - `MolmoMotion.from_pretrained(...)` knows P, H, F to expect at inference;
  - `MolmoMotionProcessor.from_pretrained(...)` reads `history_size`,
    `image_size`, etc. to assemble inputs;
  - users who want to train from scratch have a documented config surface.

(The lower-level `BaseConfig`/`StrEnum`/`DType` infrastructure used by the
internal model machinery lives in `molmo_motion.config`. End users do not
typically interact with that.)

    """Configuration for the MolmoMotion model.

    Inherits `PretrainedConfig` so `save_pretrained` / `from_pretrained`
    serialize this to / from `config.json` in the HF cache directory.

    Attributes:
        num_points: P — number of points the model predicts the trajectory
            of per example.
        history_size: H — number of history RGB frames the model consumes.
            Fixed per checkpoint; the H=1 and H=3 release variants differ
            only in this field (and the matching `max_history_frames` in
            the vision preprocessor).
        future_size: Nominal F used at training time. At inference the user
            picks any `future_horizon`; the model's max generation length
            is bounded by `max_sequence_length` regardless.
        image_size: Input resolution to the SigLIP2+DINOv2 vision encoder.
        patch_size: ViT patch size. With image_size=378 this gives
            27×27=729 patches.
        vision_embed_dim: SigLIP2 (1152) + DINOv2 (1024) concatenated.
        max_sequence_length: Context window. The pretrain v3 release is
            2560; finetuned long-horizon variants may bump to 6144.
        max_new_tokens: If None, derived at inference time from
            (max_sequence_length - input_token_budget).
        coord_scale: Internal text format multiplies meter-deltas by this
            before rounding to ints. Users don't see this —
            `predict_trajectory` un-scales for them.
